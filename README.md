### ez-framework

# abstract
-----
	- to provide a small file size
	- deliver a basic responsive grid and type system in a single javascript file.
	- instead of using media queries, use a simple concept of device type:
		- mobile
		- tablet
		- desktop
		- huge desktop
	- scale typography with respect to screen size, and device type ie:
		- make text larger for large mobiles since they have higher resolution, basing off of mobile text sizes.
		- make text larger for huge desktops, basing off of desktop text sizes.
	- needs to render fast
	- no dependencies; PERIOD!
