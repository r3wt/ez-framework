### ez-framework

# abstract
-----
- to provide a small file size
- deliver a basic responsive grid and type system in a single javascript file.
- instead of using media queries, use a simple concept of device type:
	- mobile
	- tablet
	- desktop
	- huge desktop
- scale typography with respect to screen size, and device type ie:
	- make text larger for large mobiles since they have higher resolution, basing off of mobile text sizes.
	- make text larger for huge desktops, basing off of desktop text sizes.
- needs to render fast
- no dependencies; PERIOD!
